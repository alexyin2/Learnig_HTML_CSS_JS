# Learnig_HTML_CSS_JS
* This is a learning note of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
* Since I'm still a novice. I'll get started with the basics.
* We'll first introduce how to create a HTML file in mac without using other applications, e.g., HBuilder.
* 在mac中，直接使用文字編輯寫HTML會有編排字體樣式等問題，
* 因此最好的方法是透過Terminal直接在桌面產生一個txt檔案，再將其轉換為html格式。

* 方法：
  1. 開啟Terminal
  2. 輸入：
```
cd Desktop (This is not necessary, just decide where you want to create your file)
touch name.txt
```
* You then will get a pure txt file on your desktop.

* Still highly recommended to use other applications since you'll need to connect between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
